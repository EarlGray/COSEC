View 'make help' output for a brief information.

You need just basic tools (GNU make, gcc, optionally objdump, ctags) for 
compilation on Linux (both 32 and 64 bit), Mac OS X support is in progress.  
To run it,  you need QEMU or Bochs, VirtualBox (for the latter create VM named 
COSEC with cosec.img attached) installed.  Default action of Makefile is 
running kernel, so you just need to do 
    $ make
(you'll need root permissions to mount floppy image)

In order to just compile, do 
    $ make kernel

Root privileges: unless you have fuseext2 installed (this is checked by Makefile),
mount/umount will be used, which requires sudo. You might wish to install fuseext2 
to work without root privileges, but it is still recommended to generate image with 
native sudo. In order to do use mount when fuse is installed, use
    $ make fuse=

To make boot image manually, use res/fd.tar.bz2 (floppy image with preinstalled 
GRUB, copy res/menu.lst to ${floppy.img}/boot/grub/, put ${kernel} to ${floppy}/.
For GRUB: use 'multiboot' command or 'kernel --type=multiboot (fd0)/kernel' before 
'boot'!
