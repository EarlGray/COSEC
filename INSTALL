View 'make help' output for a brief information.

You need just basic tools (GNU make, gcc, optionally objdump, ctags) for 
compilation on Linux (both 32 and 64 bit), Mac OS X support is in progress.  
To run it,  you need QEMU or Bochs, VirtualBox (for the latter create VM named 
COSEC with cosec.img attached) installed.  Default action of Makefile is 
running kernel, so you just need to do 
    $ make
(you'll need root permissions to mount floppy image)

In order to just compile, do 
    $ make kernel

To make boot image manually, use res/fd.tar.bz2 with preinstalled GRUB, copy 
res/menu.lst to ${floppy.img}/boot/grub/, put ${kernel} to ${floppy}/.
