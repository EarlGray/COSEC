SECD machine
============

This is a loose implementation of [SECD machine](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SECD) and a simple self-hosted Scheme-to-SECD compiler/interpreter.

Quick run:
```
$ ./secdscheme
;>> (+ 2 2)
   4

;>> (define n 10)
   n

;>> (define (sqr x) (* x x))
   sqr

;>> (define apply-to-42 (lambda (g) (g 42)))
   apply-to-42

;>> (apply-to-42 sqr)
1764

;>> (define (fact n) (if (eq? n 0) 1 (* n (fact (- n 1)))))
   fact

;>> (fact 10)
3628800

;>> (load "tests/lists.scm")
   ok

;>> (filter odd (range 12))
   (1 3 5 7 9 11)

;>> (begin (display 'bye) (quit))
bye
$
```

The design is mostly inspired by detailed description in _Functional programming: Application and Implementation_ by Peter Henderson and his LispKit, but is not limited by the specific details of traditional SECD implementations (like 64 Kb size of heap, etc) and R7RS.

Here is [a series of my blog posts about SECD machine](http://dmytrish.wordpress.com/2013/08/09/secd-about)

Opcodes and operational semantics
---------------------------------

The machine's state is represented as tuple of 4 lists:
* S for (computational) stack
* E for environment:
        Environment is a list of frames.
        Each frame is a pair (cons) of two lists:
            the first for symbol names,
            the second for bound values.
        The first frame represents the global environment and built-in routines.
* C for control path (list of opcodes to execute)
* D for dump (stack): it's for storing S/E/C that must be restored later

This state is written as `(s, e, c, d)`.

Notation: `(x.s)` means cons of value `x` and list `s`. Recursively, `(x.y.s)` means `(x.(y.s))`. An empty list may be written as `nil`, so `(v.nil)` is equal to `(v)`, `(x.y.nil)` to `(x y)`, etc.

**The current opcode set and the operational semantics**:

    ADD, SUB, MUL, DIV, REM
            :  (x.y.s, e, OP.c, d)     -> ((x OP y).s, e, c, d)
    LEQ     :  (x.y.s, e, LEQ.c, d)    -> ((x < y? #t : nil).s, e, c, d)

    CAR     :  ((x._).s, e, CAR.c, d)  -> (x.s, e, c, d)
    CDR     :  ((_.x).s, e, CDR.c, d)  -> (x.s, e, c, d)
    CONS    :  (x.y.s, e, CONS.c, d)   -> ((x.y).s, e, c, d)

    LDC v   :  (s, e, LDC.v.c, d)      -> (v.s, e, c, d)
    LD sym  :  (s, e, LD.sym.c, d)     -> ((lookup e sym).s, e, c, d)

    TYPE    :  (v.s, e, TYPE.c, d)     -> ((typeof v).s, e, c, d)
                where typeof returns a symbol describing variable type
    EQ      :  (v1.v2.s, e, EQ.c, d)   -> ((eq? v1 v2).s, e, c, d)

    SEL     :  (v.s, e, SEL.thenb.elseb.c, d)
                         -> (s, e, (if v then thenb else elseb), c.d)
    JOIN    :  (s, e, JOIN.nil, c.d) -> (s, e, c, d)

    LDF     :  (s, e, LDF.(args body).c, d) -> (clos.s, e, c, d)
                    where closure `clos` is ((args body).e);
                          `args` is a list of argument name symbols;
                          `body` is control path of the function.

    AP      :  (((args c') . e').argv.s, e, AP.c, d)
               -> (nil, (frame args argv).e', c', s.e.c.d)
                    -- a closure ((args c1) . e') must be on the stack, 
                    -- followed by list of argument values `argv`.

    RTN     :   (v.nil, e', RTN.nil, s.e.c.d) -> (v.s, e, c, d)

    DUM     :   (s, e, DUM.c, d)            -> (s, 立.e, c, d)
    RAP     :   (clos.argv.s, 立.e, RAP.c, d)
                -> (nil, set-car!(frame(args, argv), 立.e'), c', s.e.c.d)
                    where `clos` is ((args c').(立.e'))

    PRINT   :  side-effect of printing the head of S:
                (v.s, e, PRINT.c, d) -> (v.s, e, c, d) -- printing v

    READ    :  puts the input s-expression on top of S:
                (s, e, READ.c, d) -> ((read).s, e, c, d)

There are functions implemented in C (`native.c`):
- `append`, `list`: heavily used by the compiler, native for efficiency;
- `eof-object?`, `secd-hash`, `defined?`;
- `secd-bind!` used for binding global variables like `(secd-bind! 'sym val)`. Top-level `define` macros desugar to `secd-bind!`;
- i/o related: `display`, `open-input-file`, `open-input-string`, `read-char`, `read-u8`, `read-string`, `port-close`;
- `secd`: takes a symbol as the first argument, outputs the following: current tick number with `(secd 'tick)`, prints current environment for `(secd 'env)`, shows how many cells are available with `(secd 'free)`; memory info with `(secd 'mem)`, the array heap layout with  `(secd 'heap)`.
- `interaction-environment` - this native form returns the current environment, the last frame is the global environment;
- vector-related: `make-vector`, `vector-length`, `vector-ref`, `vector-set!`, `vector->list`, `list->vector`;
- bytevectors: `make-bytevector`, `bytevector-length`, `bytevector-u8-ref`, `bytevector-u8-set!`, `utf8->string`, `string->utf8`;
- string-related: `string-length`, `string-ref`, `string->list`, `list->string`, `symbol->string`, `string->symbol`;
- `char->integer`, `integer->char`;

**About types:**
Supported types are (secd `secd.h`, `enum cell_type`:
- CONSes that make persistent lists;
- ARRAYs, that implement Scheme vectors;
- STR, implementing UTF-8 encoded Unicode strings. Strings are immutable, contrary to R7RS;
- BYTES, implementing bytevectors as described in R7RS;
- SYMs, implementing symbols;
- INTs, a platform-specific `long int` C type; not an arbitrary-precision integer;
- CHARs, a unicode point below 0x10fff;
- FUNCs, built-in native functions;
- OPs, SECD operations;
- PORTs, Scheme I/O ports, file/string based, with other backends possible in the future;

Internal types:
- CELL_UNDEF, non-initialized value that is default for cells in non-initialized vectors;
- CELL_FRAME, a frame of the environment;
- CELL_ARRMETA: cells for arrays metainformation;
- CELL_REF: just a pointer to another cell; used to include NILs into arrays;
- CELL_FREE: this cell may be allocated;
- CELL_ERROR: contains an exception thrown by failed opcode execution;

Boolean values are Scheme symbols `#t` and `#f`. Any values except `#f` are evaluated to `#t`.

Values are persistent, immutable and shared. Arrays are really handles for access to "mutable" memory.  Array cells are owned by its array and are copied on every access from Scheme. Setting a cell in array means destructing the previous value and initialization of the cell with copy of the previous value. If you want to emulate mutable variable, use array boxing:
``` Scheme
;; emulating a counter object:
(define (counter)
  (let ((count (make-vector 1 0))
    (let ((get (lambda () (vector-ref count 0)))
          (inc (lambda () (vector-set! count 0 (+ 1 (vector-ref count 0))))))
      (lambda (msg)
        (cond
          ((eq? msg 'inc) (inc))
          ((eq? msg 'get) (get))
          (else 'doesnotunderstand)))))))

(define c (counter))
(c 'get)  ;; => 0
(c 'inc)
(c 'get)  ;; => 1
```

**Memory management**:
Memory is managed using reference counting by default, a simple optional Mark&Sweep garbage collection is available as `(secd 'gc)` 

**Input/output**: `READ`/`PRINT` are implemented as built-in opcodes in C code.  Scheme ports are half-implemented at the moment (see the list of native I/O functions).  `(load "path/to/file.scm")` is implemented by the interpreter.

**Tail-recursion**: added tail-recursive calls optimization.
The criterion for tail-recursion optimization: given a function A which calls a function B, which calles a function C, if B does not mess the stack after C call (that is, returns the value produced by C to A), we can drop saving B state (its S,E,C) on the dump when calling C. "Not messing the stack" means that there are no commands other than `JOIN`, `RTN` and combo `CONS CAR` (used by the Scheme compiler to implement `(begin)` forms) between `AP` in B and B's `RTN`. Also all `SEL` return points saved on the dump must be dropped.
The check for validity of TR optimization is done by function `new_dump_if_tailrec()` in `secd.c` for every AP.

Tail-recursion modifies AP operation to not save S,E,C of the current function on the dump, also dropping all conditional branches return points saved on the dump:

    AP (with TR)  :  ( ((args c').e').argv.s, e, AP.c, j1.j2...jN.d) 
                     -> (nil, frame(args, argv).e', c', d)
                        where j1, j2, ..., jN are jump return points saved by SELs in the current function.
    
    RTN           :  not changed, it just loads A's state from the dump in C's `RTN`.
                        

How to run
----------
`secdscheme` wrapper scripts tries to silently build all it needs:
``` bash
$ ./secdscheme
# compiles ./secd binary
# creates repl.secd from repl.scm if not found
;> (display "Hello Scheme!")
Hello Scheme!
```

Detailed process is:

First of all, compile the machine:
```bash
$ make
```

Examples of running SECD opcode sequences (lines starting with `>` are user input):

```bash
$ echo "(LDC 2  LDC 2  ADD PRINT)" | ./secd
4

$ ./secd < tests/test_fact.secd
720

# read from file first, then from the stdin
$ cat tests/test_io.secd - | ./secd
# or
$ ./secd tests/test_io.secd
> 1
(Looks like an atom)
> ^D
```

`secd` binary may be also used for interactive evaluation of control paths:
```bash
# without STOP, the control path is considered to be incomplete.
$ ./secd
> (LDC 2  LDC 2  ADD STOP)
4
```
See `tests/` directory for more examples of closures/recursion/IO in SECD codes.


Scheme compiler: scm2secd.scm and repl.scm
------------------------------------------

This file a simple compiler from Scheme to SECD code. It is written in a quite limited subset of Scheme (using `let`/`letrec` instead of `define`, though now it supports `define` definitions).
There is a `define` macro. It is implemented as a macro that desugars to a native function `(secd-bind! 'symbol value)`. A macro can be defined with macro `define-macro` which works just like in Guile.

The compiler is self-hosted and can be bootstrapped using its pre-compiled SECD code in `scm2secd.secd`:

```bash
# self-bootstrapping:
$ ./secd scm2secd.secd <scm2secd.scm >scm2secd.1.secd
$ mv scm2secd.1.secd scm2secd.secd

# or, using a bootstrapping interpreter (tested with guile and mzscheme):
$ guile -s scm2secd.scm <scm2secd.scm >scm2secd.secd
$ mzscheme -f scm2secd.scm <scm2secd.scm >scm2secd.secd
```

Scheme expression and files may be evaluated this way:
```bash
$ cat tests/append.scm | ./secd scm2secd.secd | ./secd
```

Bootstrapping REPL: 
```bash
$ ./secd scm2secd.secd <repl.scm >repl.secd
$ ./secd repl.secd
> (append '(1 2 3) '(4 5 6))
(1 2 3 4 5 6)
> (begin (display 'bye) (quit))
bye
$
```

Use `secd-compile` function to examine results of Scheme-to-SECD conversion in the REPL:
```scheme
> (secd-compile '(+ 2 2))
(LDC 2 LDC 2 ADD)
> (eval '(+ 2 2) (interaction-environment))
4
```
