    the Coolest Operation System Ever Created
    -----------------------------------------

I'm kidding :) 
Seriously, it's just my first effort in writing OS for protected mode of x86.
It is quite simple and buggy, you won't see anything great for a long time.

Tools, languages and platform used:
- gcc 4.5, GNU make;
- written in C with gas assembly;
- aimed for i386 CPUs;
- loaded with GRUB, multiboot specification;

Features:
...oops, I've got nothing to say here

System had run in VirtualBox and qemu for now.
