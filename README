    the Coolest Operation System Ever Created
    -----------------------------------------

I'm kidding :) 
Seriously, it's just my first effort in writing OS for protected mode of x86.
It is quite simple and buggy, you won't see anything great for a long time.

Tools, languages and platform used:
- gcc 4.5, GNU make;
- written in C with gas assembly;
- aimed for i386 CPUs;
- loaded with GRUB, multiboot specification;

Features:
- interrupts set, keyboard works.
Nothing more yet.

How to run it.
You need just basic tools (GNU make, gcc) for compilation. To run it, you need
VirtualBox 3, QEMU or Bochs installed. Default action of Makefile is running kernel,
so you just need to do
     $ make
Please report issues.
